 - project k -- a small, portable .net and asp.net that can, for example be deployed from a mac
  - allows side by side installs of multiple versions, like virtualenv?
  - project.json to specify nuget dependencies, rather than traditional .csproj (i think)

 - visual studio daily builds -- support for projects in python and other languages
  - ability to launch multiple browsers at once, use web sockets to communicate in-place changes from
  google chrome debugging tools to your razor templates / html
  - only the jitter of .net remains closed (compiler and runtime open)
  - azure allows hosting in many more languages and platforms than .net
  - azure for globally-depeloyed nodes with monitoring

  lunch with doris chen
  - TypeScript wants to remain even more open and community driven than the ECMA standard
  - there's really a preference to continue to use modern tools like javascript and node
    for front end and UI development rather than XAML or that junk
